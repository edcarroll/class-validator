# Release notes

**0.6.5-0.6.6**

* fixed bugs with `@IsUrl`, `@IsEmail` and several other decorators

**0.6.4**

**0.6.3**

**0.6.1**

* added `@IsArray` decorator.

**0.6.0**

* added `@ValidateIf` decorator, see conditional validation in docs.
* breaking change with `@ValidateNested` on arrays: Validator now groups the validation errors by sub-object, rather than them all being grouped together. See #32 for a demonstration of the updated structure.

**0.5.0**

* async validations must be marked with `{ async: true }` option now.
This is optional, but it helps to determine which decorators are async to prevent their execution in `validateSync` method.
* added `validateSync` method that performs non asynchronous validation and ignores validations that marked with `async: true`.
